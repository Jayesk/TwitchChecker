# TwitchChecker
TwitchChecker is a lightweight script which uses the Twitch API to check if a certain streamer is live. Just run the script, enter the Twitch username and thats it!

## Features:
- No need for any application ID's or secrets.
- Updates every 15 seconds.
- Change the Twitch channel in seconds through console input.
- Timestamped console entries for easy implementation into other projects.

## Coming Soon:
- Ability to change timezone so the time printed to the console is correct for wherever you are located.

## Notes:
- The Date and Time in the script is set in the GMT timezone so will be incorrect for the majority of users.
