# TwitchChecker
TwitchChecker is a lightweight script which uses the Twitch API to check if a certain streamer is live. You can change the "channelName" variable to the streamer name for your preferred streamer to be checked by the script, by default it is set to 'xQcOW'.

# Update Times
The script by default updates every 15 seconds, to change how often this updates, change the two '15.0's at the bottom line of the script to the specified number of seconds being in the format of 'SECOND.MILLISECONDS'.

# Date and Time
The Date and Time in the script is set in the GMT timezone. I am planning on adding features which allow you to change this soon.
